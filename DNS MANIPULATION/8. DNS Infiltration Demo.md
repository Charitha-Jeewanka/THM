# Introduction
- In this scenario the **attacker is going to infiltrate a piece of 'malicious' code onto the victim's computer.** 
- There are many different techniques that attackers in the real world use to achieve this. To simplify things, I will be using a TXT Record that is setup on my public AWS DNS Server. The value contained in this record is encoded 'malicious' code.

- Since TXT Records are limited to 255 characters the hackers will most likely have multiple TXT Records configured for their DNS Server. 
- This ultimately depends on how long their code is. 
- Now that everything is setup and ready; all the hacker needs to do is request those TXT Record/s, capture the value/s, decode them and boom.. they now have infiltrated their own code into a compromised system via DNS TXT Records.
