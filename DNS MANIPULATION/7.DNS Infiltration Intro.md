# DNS infiltration
- DNS infiltration is another method used by attackers to exploit the various vulnerabilities within an organization's Domain Name System. 
- Unlike the exfiltration attacks on the DNS, infiltration defines the process where malicious code is ran to manipulate DNS servers either using automated systems where attackers connect remotely to the network infrastructure or manually.

- DNS infiltration is **primarily used for file dropping or malware staging efforts.** 
- With behavioral, signature based, or reputation based threat detection systems it's possible this attack method could be caught.

- However, if this method of transporting data goes unnoticed it could lead to malicious activity such as code execution in organization's environment. Historically, this has caused havoc and disruption for various well known companies.

- In summary, the DNS protocol could be used as a covert protocol that could aid in malware staging and execution efforts to communicate back to an attacker's **C2 (Command and Control) server/s.**
