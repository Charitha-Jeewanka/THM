## Python code used for DNS Exfiltration and Infiltration

I have created a few simple scripts written in Python for you to complete this walkthrough. This will allow us to make DNS queries to a remote DNS Server.
		
	`git clone https://github.com/kleosdc/dns-exfil-infil`

Also, make sure you have the required Python3 modules in order to run the python code.

Use the following command to install the required modules:

	sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Program used for DNS Tunneling

	sudo apt install iodine

## Download Wireshark

You may use Wireshark or tshark to capture packets. The python code uses .PCAP file to extract the captured data and then decode it.

	sudo apt install -y tshark
