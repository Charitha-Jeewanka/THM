# DNS Exfiltration

- DNS Exfiltration is a cyberattack on servers via the DNS, which can be performed manually or automatically depending on the *attacker's physical location* and *proximity to the target devices*. 
	- In a manual scenario, attackers often gain unauthorized physical access to the targeted device to extract data from the environment. 
	- In automated DNS exfiltration, attackers use malware to conduct the data exfiltration while inside the compromised network.

- DNS is a service that will usually be available on a target machine and allowing outbound *traffic typically over TCP or UDP port 53.* This makes DNS a prime candidate for hackers to use for exfiltrating data.

- Data exfiltration through DNS could allow an attacker to transfer a large volume of data from the target environment. 
- Moreover, DNS exfiltration is mostly used as a **pathway to gather personal information** such as social security numbers, intellectual property, or other personally identifiable information.

- DNS exfiltration is mostly used by adding strings containing the desired *'loot'* to DNS UDP requests. 
- The string containing the loot would then be sent to a rogue DNS server that is logging these requests. 
- To the untrained eye this could look like normal DNS traffic or these requests could be lost in the shuffle of many legit DNS requests.
