# Introduction

At a high level, a Domain Name System refers to a naming system that resolves domain names with IP addresses. DNS servers are distributed all across the world and they are constantly being updated and synced amongst each other in a systematic way. When a user makes a request using a domain name such as tryhackme.com, DNS 'translates' this to its IP address then ultimately supplies the requester with the correct IP address. It's also worth noting that in some scenarios the IP address returned by DNS won't always be the origin server's IP address If DNS records are being proxied by a service such as Cloudflare's DDoS protection.

Technically, every device connected to the internet has an IP address which acts as an identity when communicating with other internet devices. Therefore, it is essential to understand that the DNS's primary function and the hierarchy the 'translation' traverses.

DNS root name servers sit at the top or 'root' of the DNS hierarchy and play a critical role for the Internet. Information for all the top level domain (TLD) 'zones' such as .com, .co.uk, .net and their associated name servers are housed in the hundreds of root name servers that are distributed across the world.

Below is an illustration from Cloudflare to better picture this hierarchy.

There are more DNS Record types. However, they won't be necessary to know in order to complete this walkthrough.
