# DNS Tunneling

- Companies will typically have Firewalls, an **IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems)** and/or and **IPSs (Intrusion Protection Systems)** in place in order prevent/alert when unwanted inbound and outbound protocols pass through their network. 
- **The one protocol that is rarely monitored by companies is DNS.** Because of this, hackers are able to bypass a lot of the 'unwanted' protocols by using DNS tunneling.

### Demo

For this demo we'll explore how a hacker could bypass various restricted websites by *using HTTP over DNS*. To achieve this I will be using 'Iodine'. You can read more about 'Iodine' here: [Iodine](https://code.kryo.se/iodine/)

#### Setup

- AWS Hosted Linux machine that will be the **DNS Tunnel Server.**
- Ubuntu VM running on local computer that will be the **DNS Tunnel Client.**
- [Public Domain Name](badbadtunnel.in) hosted on Google Domains.

###### DNS Configuration
![[THM/DNS MANIPULATION/IMG/I6.PNG]]

**To get started, both machines need to have iodine installed.**

`iodine` - Client

`iodined` - Server

On the AWS server we start the iodined with the following arguments
![[THM/DNS MANIPULATION/IMG/I7.PNG]]

- *Port* - `27001`
- *IP for DNS Tunnel Server* - `10.0.0.1`
- *Subdomain name* - `tunnel.badbadtunnel.in`

Now on our Client machine we run iodine with these arguements:

### IP of DNS Tunnel Server
#### Subdomain name
- If everything is setup correctly we should now have connection to our DNS Tunnel Server. 
- Try to ping 10.0.0.1 (DNS Tunnel Server) to see if connected.

***Success!***

- Now we are about half-way done. Our **HTTP over DNS is not fully setup yet.** 

- First, *generate a SSH key and upload the content* of `id_rsa.pub` to our DNS Tunnel Server in the `authorized_keys` file. Here are the steps.

This is the content of id_rsa.pub

Here you can see that I added the id_rsa.pub content to the authorized_keys on my DNS Server. This will allow me to SSH into my Server.

Now we can SSH to our DNS Tunnel Server with option -D 8080
![[I13.PNG]]

- Almost there, now we just need to open our browser (Firefox in this case) and *change the proxy settings.* 
	- There are also browser extensions such as *FoxyProxy or Proxy SwitchyOmega.*
- For the Proxy options, we need to select 'Manual proxy configuration'.
- Set the SOCKS Host with the IP address `127.0.0.1` and for Port number to `8080`.

***Done!***
We are now using HTTP over DNS... If we go to myip.is we should see our DNS Tunnel Server's Public IP Address.
