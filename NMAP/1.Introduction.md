# NMAP introduction
Say we have been given an IP (or multiple IP addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the “landscape” we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. **The first stage in establishing this “map” of the landscape is something called port scanning.** When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a “port” to receive the connection.  *Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available.* 

###### Example
- When you load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program must have some way of determining which tab is loading which web page. 
- This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine. 
	- Equally, if you want a server to be able to run more than one service (for example, perhaps you want your webserver to run both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site), then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. 
- Network connections are made between two ports – an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. 
	- For example, when you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server’s port 443.

*The diagram shows what happens when you connect to numerous websites at the same time. Your computer opens up a different, high-numbered port (at random), which it uses for all its communications with the remote server*.

### Ports
Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports.
#### Registered standard ports. 
- HTTP Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. 
- A HTTPS Webservice can be found on port 443. 
- Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and 
- SMB can be found on port 445.

If we do not know which of these ports a server has open, then we do not have a hope of successfully attacking the target; thus, **it is crucial that we begin any attack with a port scan.**
