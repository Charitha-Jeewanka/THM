# Finding the scripts
## Options for finding scripts
These should ideally be used in conjunction with each other. 
1.  Page on the Nmap website (mentioned in the previous [[10.Working with NSE]])
2.  The local storage on your attacking machine. 
	- Nmap stores its scripts on Linux at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`. All of the NSE scripts are stored in this directory by default.

### Ways of searching for installed scripts
There are two ways to search for installed scripts. 
1.  Using the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db` file.
	- This isn't actually a database so much as a formatted text file containing filenames and categories for each available script.
	- Nmap uses this file to keep track of (and utilise) scripts for the scripting engine.
	- We can grep through it to look for scripts
	- Example: `grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`


### Installing New Scripts
 - If one of these NSE files is missing in the scripts directory locally.
	 - A standard `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap` should fix this. 
	- However, it's also possible to install the scripts manually by downloading the script from Nmap 
	- `sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse`. 
	- This must then be followed up with `nmap --script-updatedb`, which updates the script.db file to contain the newly downloaded script.

It's worth noting that you would require the same "`updatedb`" command if you were to *make your own NSE script and add it into Nmap* -- a more than manageable task with some basic knowledge of Lua!
