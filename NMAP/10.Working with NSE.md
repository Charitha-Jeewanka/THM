# Using NSE

In [[2.Nmap Switches]] we looked very briefly at the `--script` switch for activating NSE scripts from the vuln category using `--script=vuln`.

- To run a specific script, use `--script=<script-name>` 
- Example: `--script=http-fileupload-exploiter`.

- **Multiple scripts can be run simultaneously** in this fashion by separating them by a comma. 
- Example: `--script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares`.

- Some scripts require arguments 
	- Example: Credentials, if they're exploiting an authenticated vulnerability. 
	- These can be given with the `--script-args` Nmap switch. 
	- An example of this would be with the http-put script (used to upload files using the PUT method). This takes two arguments: the URL to upload the file to, and the file's location on disk.
	- Example: `nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'`


- Note that the arguments are separated by commas, and connected to the corresponding script with periods (i.e. ` <script-name>.<argument>`).

A full list of scripts and their corresponding arguments (along with example use cases) can be found here. {{https://nmap.org/nsedoc/}}

- Nmap scripts come with built-in help menus. 
- They can be accessed using nmap` --script-help <script-name>`.
