# nslookup

### Finding the IP address of a domain name using nslookup 
- `nslookup`  stands for Name Server Look Up. 
- You need to issue the command `nslookup DOMAIN_NAME`, 
	- For example, `nslookup tryhackme.com`. 
	- Or, more generally, you can use `nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER`. 


#### These three main parameters 

1. `OPTIONS` contains the **query type** as shown in the table below. 
	- For instance, you can use `A` for IPv4 addresses and `AAAA` for IPv6 addresses.
2. `DOMAIN_NAME` is the domain name you are looking up.
3. `SERVER` is the **DNS server that you want to query**. 
	- You can choose any local or public DNS server to query. 
	- Cloudflare offers 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 
	- Google offers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 
	- Quad9 offers 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112. 
	- There are many [more public DNS servers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dns&ia=answer) that you can choose from if you want alternatives to your ISP’s DNS servers.

###### EXAMPLE
For instance, `nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1` (or `nslookup -type=a tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1` as it is case-insensitive) can be used to **return all the IPv4 addresses used by tryhackme.com.**

# dig
- For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality, you can use dig. 
- The acronym for **“Domain Information Groper,”** 
- Let’s use dig to look up the MX records and compare them to nslookup. 
- We can use `dig DOMAIN_NAME`, 
- but to specify the record type, we would use `dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`. 
- Optionally, we can select the server we want to query using `dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`.

1. *SERVER* is the DNS server that you want to query.
2. *DOMAIN_NAME* is the domain name you are looking up.
3. *TYPE* contains the DNS record type, as shown in the table provided earlier.

A quick comparison between the output of `nslookup` and` dig` shows that `dig` returned more information, such as the` TTL` (Time To Live) by default. If you want to query a 1.1.1.1 DNS server, you can execute `dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX`
