# whois
- WHOIS is a request and response protocol that follows the [RFC 3912](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3912.txt) specification. 
- A **WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests**. 
- The **domain registrar** is **responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing.** 
- The WHOIS server replies with various information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest.

	1. *Registrar*: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
	2. *Contact info of registrant*: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)
	3. *Creation, update, and expiration dates*: When was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
	4. *Name Server*: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?

#### Syntax
- The syntax is `whois DOMAIN_NAME`, where `DOMAIN_NAME` is the domain about which you are trying to get more information.
