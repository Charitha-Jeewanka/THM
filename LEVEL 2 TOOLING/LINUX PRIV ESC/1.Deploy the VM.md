This room is aimed at walking you through a variety of Linux Privilege Escalation techniques. To do this, you must first deploy an intentionally vulnerable Debian VM. This VM was created by Sagi Shahar as part of his [local privilege escalation workshop](https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop) but has been updated by Tib3rius as part of his [Linux Privilege Escalation for OSCP and Beyond!](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation/?referralCode=0B0B7AA1E52B4B7F4C06) course on Udemy. Full explanations of the various techniques used in this room are available there, along with demos and tips for finding privilege escalations in Linux.

Make sure you are connected to the TryHackMe VPN or using the in-browser Kali instance before trying to access the Debian VM!

SSH should be available on port 22. You can login to the "user" account using the following command:

	ssh user@MACHINE_IP

If you see the following message: "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?" type yes and press Enter.

The password for the "user" account is "password321".

The next tasks will walk you through different privilege escalation techniques. After each technique, you should have a root shell. Remember to exit out of the shell and/or re-establish a session as the "user" account before starting the next task!
