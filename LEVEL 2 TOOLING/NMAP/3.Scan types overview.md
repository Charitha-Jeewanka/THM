# Scan types

### Three basic scan types

    1. TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
    2. SYN "Half-open" Scans (-sS)
    3. UDP Scans (-sU)

### Less common port scan types

    1. TCP Null Scans (-sN)
    2. TCP FIN Scans (-sF)
    3. TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)
	

#### Note
Most of these (with the exception of UDP scans) are used for very similar purposes, however, the way that they work differs between each scan. This means that, whilst *one of the first three scans are likely to be your go-to in most situations, it's worth bearing in mind that other scan types exist.*

In terms of network scanning, we will also look briefly at *ICMP (or "ping") scanning.*
