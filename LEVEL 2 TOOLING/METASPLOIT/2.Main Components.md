# Metasploit framework

- While using the Metasploit Framework, you will primarily interact with the *Metasploit console.*  
	- *Command* : `msfconsole`
- The console will be your main interface to interact with the different modules of the Metasploit Framework. 
- Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.

## Concepts

1. **Exploit** : A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
2. **Vulnerability** : A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
3. **Payload** : An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

### Modules and categories
#### Auxiliary
- *Any supporting module*, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.

#### Encoders 
- Encoders will *allow you to encode the exploit and payload* in the *hope* that a **signature-based antivirus solution may miss them**
	- Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.

#### Evasion 
- While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software.
	- On the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.

#### Exploits 
- Exploits, neatly organized by target system.

#### NOPs
- NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally.

- They are *represented in the Intel x86 CPU family* they are **represented with 0x90**, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. 
- They are *often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes*

#### Payloads 
- Payloads are codes that will run on the target system.

- Exploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. 
	- Examples could be, 
		- Getting a shell, 
		- Loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, 
		- Running a command, or launching calc.exe as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report. 
			- *Starting the calculator on the target system remotely by launching the calc.exe application is a benign way to show that we can run commands on the target system.*

##### Different directories under payloads
1. Singles 
	- Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
2. Stagers 
	- Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. 
	- Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). 
	- This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
3. Stages
	- Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

***Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify single (also called “inline”) payloads and staged payloads.***

    generic/shell_reverse_tcp
    windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

- Both are reverse Windows shells. 
- The **former is an inline (or single) payload**, as indicated by the “_” between “shell” and “reverse”. 
- While the **latter is a staged payload**, as *indicated by the “/” between “shell” and “reverse”.*

#### Post
- Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.
