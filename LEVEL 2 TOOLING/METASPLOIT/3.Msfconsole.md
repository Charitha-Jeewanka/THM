# Basics
- The console will be your main interface to the Metasploit Framework. You can launch it using the `msfconsole` command on any system the Metasploit Framework is installed on.
- It will *support most Linux commands*, including `clear` (to clear the terminal screen), but *will not allow you to use some features of a regular command line* (e.g. does not support output redirection)

## Management by context
- Msfconsole is managed by context.
	-  This means **that unless set as a global variable, all parameter settings will be lost if you change the module you have decided to use.** 

###### EXAMPLE
-  In the example below, we have used the `ms17_010_eternalblue` exploit, and we have set parameters such as `RHOSTS.` 
-  If we were to switch to another module (e.g. a port scanner), *we would need to set the RHOSTS value again as all changes we have made remained in the context of the ms17_010_eternalblue exploit.*

- Once you type the `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` command, you will see the command line prompt change from **msf6** to “**msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue)**”. 
- The *EternalBlue* is an **exploit allegedly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (N.S.A.) for a vulnerability affecting the SMBv1 server on numerous Windows systems.** 
- The *SMB (Server Message Block)* is *widely used in Windows networks for file sharing and even for sending files to printers.* 
- EternalBlue was leaked by the cybercriminal group "Shadow Brokers" in April 2017. 
- In May 2017, this vulnerability was exploited worldwide in the WannaCry ransomware attack. 

- The **prompt tells us we now have a context set** in which we will work. You can see this by typing the `show options` command.

- The example above shows that this exploit will require we set variables like `RHOSTS` and `RPORT`. 

#### show command | more
- The `show` command can be used in any context followed by a module type *(auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.)* to *list available modules.*

- If used from the *msfconsole prompt*, the `show` command will list all modules.
- The `use` and `show` options commands we have seen so far are identical for all modules in Metasploit.
- You can *leave the context* using the `back` command.
- Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the `info` command **within its context**
- Alternatively, you can use the *info command followed by the module’s path from the msfconsole prompt*
	- `info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

### Search

- One of the most useful commands in msfconsole is `search`. 
- This command will *search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter.* 
	- CVE numbers 
	- Exploit names (eternalblue, heartbleed, etc.)
	- Target system
- The output of the search command provides an overview of each returned module.
- Another essential piece of information returned is in the “rank” column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability. The table below provides their respective descriptions.
